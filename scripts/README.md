# Scripts README

Hi team, Anvin here. This directory will hold any useful scripts for automating tasks related to the Skyron project.

## Objective

The purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized location for scripts that help with development, testing, and deployment.

## What to put in here

As the project grows, we can add scripts for things like:

- **`run_data_processing.sh`:** A script to run the entire data processing pipeline, from PDF extraction to embedding storage.
- **`train_model.sh`:** A script to launch the model training process, with parameters for specifying the base model, dataset, and training hyperparameters.
- **`start_app.sh`:** A script to start the final application.
- **`run_tests.sh`:** A script to run all the tests for the project.

## How to Contribute

If you find yourself repeatedly typing the same set of commands, consider turning them into a script and adding it to this directory. This will help to automate our workflows and make our lives easier!
