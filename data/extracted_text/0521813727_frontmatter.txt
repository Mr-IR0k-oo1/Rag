Mathematical methods for physics and engineering
A comprehensive guide
The new edition of this highly acclaimed textbook contains several major additions,
including more than four hundred new exercises (with hints and answers). To match the
mathematical preparation of current senior college and university entrants, the authors
have included a preliminary chapter covering areas such as polynomial equations,
trigonometric identities, coordinate geometry, partial fractions, binomial expansions,
induction, and the proof of necessary and sufficient conditions. Elsewhere, matrix
decomposition, nearly singular matrices and non-square sets of linear equations are
treated in detail. The presentation of probability has been reorganised and greatly
extended, and includes all physically important distributions. New topics covered in a
separate statistics chapter include estimator efficiency, distributions of samples, t- and
F-tests for comparing means and variances, applications of the chi-squared distribution,
and maximum-likelihood and least-squares fitting. In other chapters the following topics
have been added: linear recurrence relations, curvature, envelopes, curve sketching, and
more refined numerical methods.
KEN RILEY read Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and proceeded to a Ph.D.
there in theoretical and experimental nuclear physics. He became a Research Associate in
elementary particle physics at Brookhaven, and then, having taken up a lectureship at the
Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, continued this research at the Rutherford Laboratory
and Stanford; in particular he was involved in the experimental discovery of a number of
the early baryonic resonances. As well as having been Senior Tutor at Clare College,
where he has taught physics and mathematics for nearly forty years, he has served on
many committees concerned with the teaching and examining of these subjects at all
levels of tertiary and undergraduate education. He is also one of the authors of 200
Puzzling Physics Problems.
MICHAEL HOBSON read Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, specialising in
theoretical physics, and remained at the Cavendish Laboratory to complete a Ph.D. in
the physics of star-formation. As a Research Fellow at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and
subsequently an Advanced Fellow of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council, he developed an interest in cosmology, and in particular in the study of
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. He was involved in the first detection
of these fluctuations using a ground-based interferometer. He is currently a University
Lecturer at the Cavendish Laboratory and his research interests include both theoretical
and observational aspects of cosmology. He is also a Director of Studies in Natural
Sciences at Trinity Hall and enjoys an active role in the teaching of undergraduate
physics and mathematics.
STEPHEN BENCE obtained both his undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences and his
Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the University of Cambridge. He then became a Research
Associate with a special interest in star-formation processes and the structure of
star-forming regions. In particular, his research has concentrated on the physics of jets
and outflows from young stars. He has had considerable experience of teaching
mathematics and physics to undergraduate and pre-university students.

Preface to the second edition
Since the publication of the first edition of this book, both through teaching the
material it covers and as a result of receiving helpful comments from colleagues,
we have become aware of the desirability of changes in a number of areas.
The most important of these is that the mathematical preparation of current
senior college and university entrants is now less thorough than it used to be.
To match this, we decided to include a preliminary chapter covering areas such
as polynomial equations, trigonometric identities, coordinate geometry, partial
fractions, binomial expansions, necessary and sufficient condition and proof by
induction and contradiction.
Whilst the general level of what is included in this second edition has not
been raised, some areas have been expanded to take in topics we now feel were
not adequately covered in the first. In particular, increased attention has been
given to non-square sets of simultaneous linear equations and their associated
matrices. We hope that this more extended treatment, together with the inclusion
of singular value matrix decomposition, will make the material of more practical
use to engineering students. In the same spirit, an elementary treatment of linear
recurrence relations has been included. The topic of normal modes has been given
a small chapter of its own, though the links to matrices on the one hand, and to
representation theory on the other, have not been lost.
Elsewhere, the presentation of probability and statistics has been reorganised to
give the two aspects more nearly equal weights. The early part of the probability
chapter has been rewritten in order to present a more coherent development
based on Boolean algebra, the fundamental axioms of probability theory and
the properties of intersections and unions. Whilst this is somewhat more formal
than previously, we think that it has not reduced the accessibility of these topics
and hope that it has increased it. The scope of the chapter has been somewhat
extended to include all physically important distributions and an introduction to
cumulants.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
Statistics now occupies a substantial chapter of its own, one that includes sys-
tematic discussions of estimators and their efficiency, sample distributions and t-
and F-tests for comparing means and variances. Other new topics are applications
of the chi-squared distribution, maximum-likelihood parameter estimation and
least-squares fitting. In other chapters we have added material on the following
topics: curvature, envelopes, curve-sketching, more refined numerical methods
for differential equations and the elements of integration using Monte Carlo
techniques.
Over the last four years we have received somewhat mixed feedback about
the number of exercises at the ends of the various chapters. After consideration,
we decided to increase the number substantially, partly to correspond to the
additional topics covered in the text but mainly to give both students and
their teachers a wider choice. There are now nearly 800 such exercises, many with
several parts. An even more vexed question has been whether to provide hints and
answers to all the exercises or just to 'the odd-numbered' ones, as is the normal
practice for textbooks in the United States, thus making the remainder more
suitable for setting as homework. In the end, we decided that hints and outline
solutions should be provided for all the exercises, in order to facilitate independent
study while leaving the details of the calculation as a task for the student.
In conclusion, we hope that this edition will be thought by its users to be
'heading in the right direction' and would like to place on record our thanks to
all who have helped to bring about the changes and adjustments. Naturally, those
colleagues who have noted errors or ambiguities in the first edition and brought
them to our attention figure high on the list, as do the staff at The Cambridge
University Press. In particular, we are grateful to Dave Green for continued LATEX
advice, Susan Parkinson for copy-editing the second edition with her usual keen
eye for detail and flair for crafting coherent prose and Alison Woollatt for once
again turning our basic LATEX into a beautifully typeset book. Our thanks go
to all of them, though of course we accept full responsibility for any remaining
errors or ambiguities, of which, as with any new publication, there are bound to
be some.
On a more personal note, KFR again wishes to thank his wife Penny for her
unwavering support, not only in his academic and tutorial work, but also in their
joint efforts to convert time at the bridge table into 'green points' on their record.
MPH is once more indebted to his wife, Becky, and his mother, Pat, for their
tireless support and encouragement above and beyond the call of duty. MPH
dedicates his contribution to this book to the memory of his father, Ronald
Leonard Hobson, whose gentle kindness, patient understanding and unbreakable
spirit made all things seem possible.

Preface to the first edition
A knowledge of mathematical methods is important for an increasing number of
university and college courses, particularly in physics, engineering and chemistry,
but also in more general science. Students embarking on such courses come from
diverse mathematical backgrounds, and their core knowledge varies considerably.
We have therefore decided to write a textbook that assumes knowledge only of
material that can be expected to be familiar to all the current generation of
students starting physical science courses at university. In the United Kingdom
this corresponds to the standard of Mathematics A-level, whereas in the United
States the material assumed is that which would normally be covered at junior
college.
Starting from this level, the first six chapters cover a collection of topics
with which the reader may already be familiar, but which are here extended
and applied to typical problems encountered by first-year university students.
They are aimed at providing a common base of general techniques used in
the development of the remaining chapters. Students who have had additional
preparation, such as Further Mathematics at A-level, will find much of this
material straightforward.
Following these opening chapters, the remainder of the book is intended to
cover at least that mathematical material which an undergraduate in the physical
sciences might encounter up to the end of his or her course. The book is also
appropriate for those beginning graduate study with a mathematical content, and
naturally much of the material forms parts of courses for mathematics students.
Furthermore, the text should provide a useful reference for research workers.
The general aim of the book is to present a topic in three stages. The first
stage is a qualitative introduction, wherever possible from a physical point of
view. The second is a more formal presentation, although we have deliberately
avoided strictly mathematical questions such as the existence of limits, uniform
convergence, the interchanging of integration and summation orders, etc. on the

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
grounds that 'this is the real world; it must behave reasonably'. Finally a worked
example is presented, often drawn from familiar situations in physical science
and engineering. These examples have generally been fully worked, since, in
the authors' experience, partially worked examples are unpopular with students.
Only in a few cases, where trivial algebraic manipulation is involved, or where
repetition of the main text would result, has an example been left as an exercise
for the reader. Nevertheless, a number of exercises also appear at the end of each
chapter, and these should give the reader ample opportunity to test his or her
understanding. Hints and answers to these exercises are also provided.
With regard to the presentation of the mathematics, it has to be accepted that
many equations (especially partial differential equations) can be written more
compactly by using subscripts, e.g. uxy for a second partial derivative, instead of
the more familiar d2u/dxdy, and that this certainly saves typographical space.
However, for many students, the labour of mentally unpacking such equations
is sufficiently great that it is not possible to think of an equation's physical
interpretation at the same time. Consequently, wherever possible we have decided
to write out such expressions in their more obvious but longer form.
During the writing of this book we have received much help and encouragement
from various colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory, Clare College, Trinity Hall
and Peterhouse. In particular, we would like to thank Peter Scheuer, whose
comments and general enthusiasm proved invaluable in the early stages. For
reading sections of the manuscript, for pointing out misprints and for numerous
useful comments, we thank many of our students and colleagues at the University
of Cambridge. We are especially grateful to Chris Doran, John Huber, Garth
Leder, Tom Körner and, not least, Mike Stobbs, who, sadly, died before the book
was completed. We also extend our thanks to the University of Cambridge and
the Cavendish teaching staff, whose examination questions and lecture hand-outs
have collectively provided the basis for some of the examples included. Of course,
any errors and ambiguities remaining are entirely the responsibility of the authors,
and we would be most grateful to have them brought to our attention.
We are indebted to Dave Green for a great deal of advice concerning typesetting
in LATEX and to Andrew Lovatt for various other computing tips. Our thanks
also go to Anja Visser and Graça Rocha for enduring many hours of (sometimes
heated) debate. At Cambridge University Press, we are very grateful to our editor
Adam Black for his help and patience and to Alison Woollatt for her expert
typesetting of such a complicated text. We also thank our copy-editor Susan
Parkinson for many useful suggestions that have undoubtedly improved the style
of the book.
Finally, on a personal note, KFR wishes to thank his wife Penny, not only for
a long and happy marriage, but also for her support and understanding during
his recent illness – and when things have not gone too well at the bridge table!
MPH is indebted both to Rebecca Morris and to his parents for their tireless
