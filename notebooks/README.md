# Notebooks README

Hi team, Anvin here. This directory is our playground!

## Objective

The `notebooks` directory is where we'll do our exploration, experimentation, and initial model development. It's a place for us to try out new ideas, to play with the data, and to get a feel for how our models are behaving.

## What to put in here

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Before we start building our models, we need to understand our data. We can use notebooks to explore the data, to visualize it, and to get a better sense of what we're working with.
- **Model Prototyping:** Notebooks are a great place to prototype new models and to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** We can use notebooks to create interactive visualizations of our data and our model's predictions.

## What not to put in here

- **Production Code:** The code in this directory is for exploration and experimentation only. It's not meant to be production-quality code. Once we have a good idea of what we want to build, we should move the code to the `src` directory and turn it into a proper Python module.

## How to Contribute

- **Share your notebooks:** If you create a notebook that you think would be useful to others, please share it!
- **Document your work:** When you create a notebook, please add a description of what it does and what you've learned. This will make it easier for others to understand your work and to build on it.

Let's use this space to be creative and to come up with new and innovative ideas!
